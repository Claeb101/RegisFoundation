Dr. ANS Regis Foundation Website

## Setup
The RegisFoundation repository contains 2 folders, a front end and back end. The front-end folder contains the angular application.
Please refer to the README.md file in FrontEnd for more information.

Please note that the back-end folder is still in development, so only development servers can run using @angular/cli.
